      <description>Data mining and machine learning skills include classification, clustering, regression and predictive analytics.
Regression projects Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) This work was the CAPSTONE project for my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in DataScience at UNSW. It worked with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), to be able to predict the different Australian states&amp;rsquo; energy demands at different future moments. While this was a team project, each individual member was assigned different duties; my duties included the linear model (LM) as well as the generalized linear model (GLM).</description>

      <description>Data visualisation &amp;amp; technical communication is more than just python graphs - it requires communicating technical ideas clearly, effectively. My excellent data visualisation include Tableau, as well as scientific papers and patents.
My data visualisation skills Data visualisation skills includes utilising software and analytical skills to create a graphic record of data that is processed and organised. For instance, a data scientist for a large sales corporation might utilise graphs or charts to illustrate the numerical and statistical data regarding the company&amp;rsquo;s sales, revenues, assets or debts.</description>

      <description>Tree and Ensemble Learning Assessment 3 This paper examines the classification of abalone age by specific physical measurements, as well as the categorical variable of sex, into four different age classes. Decision trees with pre-pruning and post-pruning, ensemble methods such as bagging and pasting, as well as neural network models were employed to examine this question.
A GridSearchCV was used to find the optimal neural network hyperparameters.
The full paper can be found here and the JupyterLab notebook can be found here.</description>

      <description>Mathematical skills Data science deals heavily with numbers, including algorithms, statistical data and mathematical formulas for quantifying and processing data. Because of this, data scientists should posses proficient mathematical skills, especially in applied mathematics. This can include algorithmic and logarithmic studies, statistical computations and calculus.

      <description>Database systems are more than just a working knowledge of SQL, but include Hadoop, MapReduce, MRJob, Hive and Spark.
Technical skills are among the hard skills that employers can require when hiring a data scientist. Statistical data, platforms for visualising data, processing software and open-source and closed source programs can be common technical skills that a data scientist may possess.

# Paul's Data Science Portfolio

## Real world experience

### [Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO)](https://github.com/the-rahul-kumar/UNSW-Group-C-Project/tree/main/src/Paul)

This work was the CAPSTONE project for my Master's degree in DataScience.  It worked with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), to be able to predict the different Australian states' energy demands at different future moments.  While this was a team project, each individual member was assigned different duties - my duties included the linear model, the generalized linear model and the GAM.  It used "roll forward analysis", where all the previous data is used to train various models to make predictions about future energy needs.

## Technical skills

Technical skills are among the hard skills that employers can require when hiring a data scientist. Statistical data, platforms for visualizing data, processing software and open-source and closed source programs can be common technical skills that a data scientist may possess.

### SQL (Database Systems)
### Hadoop (Big Data Management)
### SQL
### Hadoop and MapReduce
### MRJob and Hive
### Spark

## Mathematical skills

Data science deals heavily with numbers, including algorithms, statistical data and mathematical formulas for quantifying and processing data. Because of this, data scientists should posses proficient mathematical skills, especially in applied mathematics. This can include algorithmic and logarithmic studies, statistical computations and calculus.

### Statistical Inference
### Bayesian Inference
### Regression Analysis for Data Scientists

## Communication skills

Data science can require exceptional written communication skills, as data scientists may often provide written accounts of the projects they work on. Furthermore, data scientists can use written communication to effectively break down the details of the processes they use to complete a project.

## Data visualization skills

Data visualization skills includes utilizing software and analytical skills to create a graphic record of data that is processed and organized. For instance, a data scientist for a large sales corporation might utilize graphs or charts to illustrate the numerical and statistical data regarding the company's sales, revenues, assets or debts.

### Tableau (Data Visualization)

## Teamwork skills

This soft skill can be essential to the role of data scientist. Oftentimes, data scientists may work with or even lead a team of developers, mathematicians, researchers and other individuals that are involved in a project. Additionally, data science can involve collaboration between different departments of an organization to ensure effective communication and work productivity.

## Quantitative skills

Data scientists may also have exceptional quantitative and reasoning skills. For instance, a data scientist working for a software production firm might utilize their quantitative skills to analyze raw data, find trends, analyze the data and organize the process into a quantifiable result, such as the rate of product quality to product flaws when the company produces new software programs.

## Analytical skills

Data science can require portions of data processing operations to be devoted to analyzing raw data as well as software-interpreted data information. Because of this, data scientists tend to possess proficient analytical skills. For instance, data science may require the analysis of appropriate data to include in financial or medical reporting. A data scientist would need to be able to apply logic and reasoned thinking to efficiently analyze which data to visualize instead of data that can be set aside for other processes.
